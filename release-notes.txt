**********************************************************************************************
Release notes v2.0.0

Added install.py python script for interactive install.

This script uses user defined variables to deploy ZFS. The origonal install.sh is retained for those that prefer to set a script up for specific deployments.

The main focus for this release is to provide flexabilty at runtime. No features are added or removed. 

**********************************************************************************************
Release notes v1.0.0

Removed support for samba creation.
Divided each feature up into its own script.

This update focuses on cleaning up the scripts and making it more user friendly.
It is much easier for the user to find and edit required lines to fit their enviroment.

**********************************************************************************************
Release notes v0.5.0

Pool creation is hardcoded, change lines 18-20
Zpool snapshot configuration is hardcoded, lines 24-30
Zpool cron job set for 3am Sunday. Change on lines 38 and 40 to reflect name of pool and time.
Samba Configuration is hardcoded, adjust lines 45 - 55

This release focuses on making auto snapshots and auto scrub working as well as some misc. code cleanup. Expect version 1.0 to offer variables either through prompts or a configuration section. My goal is for version 1.0 to offer a flexible install to match environments with varying number of drives and pool requirements as allowing the user to easily set variables such as ‘samba user’ and ‘samba password’.

**********************************************************************************************
Release notes v0.0.1

The purpose of this script is to make installing ZoL (ZFS on Linux), SAMBA (native file sharing for Windows enviroments)
and email alerts much easier. Currently the script is hardcoded to fit specific use cases, however in the future I plan
to add the abilty to configure a "setup" file with variables such as "hostname, zfs raid type, numbers of drives, samba
user name, email alert username, and so on".

The current version is v0.0.1. The scirpt fits a specific use case that I currently need but could easily be adopted to
fit other enviroments. It simply makes deploying ZFS + SAMBA with email alerts much easier than going command by command.
